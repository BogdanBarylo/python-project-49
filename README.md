This is a small project that consists of 5 math games to test your math skills and have fun.


In each game, the condition to win is 3 correct answers in a row. If the user gives the wrong answer, the game will end. 

1.Game: "brain-even" The essence of the game is this: the user is shown a random number.
And he has to answer yes if the number is even, or no if it is odd.

2.Game: "brain-calc" the essence of the game: the user is shown a random mathematical expression, which must be calculated and write down the correct answer.

3.Game: "brain-gcd" the essence of the game is as follows: the user is shown two random numbers. The user must calculate and enter the greatest common divisor of these numbers.

4.Game: "brain-pogression" the essence of the game is as follows: the user is shown a random series of progression consisting of 9 numbers and one missing number. The user must enter the missing number.

5.Game: "brain-prime" the essence of the game is as follows: the user is shown a random number. The user has to answer yes if the number is prime, or no if it is not prime.
